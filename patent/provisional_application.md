## Abstract
This disclosure describes a hierarchical swarm-optimization architecture augmented with key-value episodic memory. The system couples selective surprise-based writing, context-aware retrieval, automatic forgetting, and consolidation into transformer weights to deliver human-like continual learning. The approach balances memory retention with compute budgets, supports deployment-scale inference APIs, and integrates interpretability tooling for memory lifecycle analysis.

## Background
Neural memory systems such as Memory Networks, Neural Turing Machines, and modern retrieval-augmented language models struggle with balancing plasticity and stability. Existing solutions lack unified mechanisms that combine swarm-based exploration, contextual retrieval modulation, and procedural consolidation analogous to biological sleep. Production deployments also require tooling for interpretability, benchmarking, and operational controls currently absent in the literature.

## Summary
H-SOKV introduces a multi-tier swarm of agents producing model updates, a key-value memory with context modulation, surprise-based selective writes, consolidation to model weights, and automatic forgetting of low-utility entries. The system schedules experiments, visualization, and scaling studies to provide reproducible measurements, and exposes a roadmap that spans deployment APIs and provisional patent preparation.

## Detailed Description
1. **Core Architecture**
   - Transformer backbone with integrated key-value memory.
   - Hierarchical swarm (agents, managers, supervisor) exploring optimizer and hyperparameter configurations.
   - Metadata-enriched memory entries recording confidence, recency, domain, emotion, and success statistics.
2. **Surprise-Based Writing**
   - Computes prediction surprise via cross entropy and novelty as a cosine-gap metric.
   - Writes to memory only when surprise or novelty exceeds thresholds, reducing redundancy.
3. **Context-Aware Retrieval**
   - Extracts domain and emotion signals from hidden states.
  - Applies multiplicative boosts for recency, domain alignment, emotion similarity, and importance.
4. **Consolidation and Forgetting**
   - Consolidation module identifies high-confidence memories and fine-tunes the model with synthetic samples.
   - Forgetting module prunes low-utility or interfering memories, keeping footprint within configurable bounds.
5. **Experimental Tooling**
   - Human comparison suites, scaling experiments, and cross-domain continual learning analysis.
   - Visualization module plotting timelines, statistics, and interactive reports.
6. **Deployment Considerations**
   - Production API (future work) providing endpoints for learning, querying, feedback, and metrics.
   - Docker and monitoring integrations planned for Stage 12 (not yet implemented in code).

## Claims
1. A hierarchical swarm optimization pipeline that coordinates multiple agent strategies to train a transformer with integrated key-value memory.
2. A surprise-based selective writing mechanism combining prediction error and novelty thresholds to regulate memory growth.
3. A context-aware retrieval algorithm utilizing domain, emotion, recency, and importance metadata to modulate similarity scores.
4. An automatic forgetting module that scores memory utility and prunes interfering entries based on confidence, success rate, recency, and frequency.
5. A consolidated system combining the above components with visualization, experimentation, and deployment tooling for continual learning at production scale.
